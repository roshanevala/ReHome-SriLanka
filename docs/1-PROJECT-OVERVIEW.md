# ReBuild Homes SriLanka - Project Overview

## Vision
Connect people who lost their homes in disasters with donors who want to help rebuild, through a transparent, verified, and trusted process.

## Core Concept
A **matching + verification system** that brings together three parties:
- **Side A**: Beneficiaries (people who lost homes)
- **Side B**: Donors (people/organizations wanting to help)
- **In the Middle**: Verification & matching process

## System Roles

### 1. Beneficiary Portal
For people who lost their homes to submit applications with:
- Personal details
- Disaster information
- Damage evidence
- Family situation

### 2. Donor Portal
For individuals or organizations to register their support:
- Funding commitments
- Material donations
- Labor contributions
- Preferences for helping

### 3. Admin/Verifier Portal
For trusted teams (NGOs, GN Office reps, administrators) to:
- Verify applications
- Approve eligible families
- Match donors with beneficiaries
- Track house construction progress

## Key Features

### Verification System
- Phone/WhatsApp OTP verification
- Document review (GN letters, damage photos)
- Optional field visits by local verifiers
- Priority scoring based on vulnerability

### Matching System
- Show verified families to donors
- Allow donors to sponsor full/partial houses
- Enable pooled funding for high-priority cases
- Track multiple donors per project if needed

### Project Tracking
- Construction milestones
- Photo updates at each stage
- Real-time status for donors
- Completion certificates

### Transparency & Security
- Data protection for sensitive information
- Only show necessary details to donors
- Regular updates to all parties
- Clear status tracking

## Success Metrics
- Number of verified applications

## Ethical Principles
1. **Privacy First**: Protect beneficiary data
2. **No Harm**: Avoid creating community conflicts
3. **Full Transparency**: Show donors where money goes
4. **Local Partnership**: Work with authorities and NGOs
5. **Dignity**: Treat all beneficiaries with respect
